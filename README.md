Neko wants to be a MOO inspired game.

Commands
====
Neko operates on text commands with the following syntax:

    <verb> [<direct object>] [<preposition> <indirect object>]

Parsing
=====
First, the command is tokenized so that `'foo "bar mumble" baz" "fro"tz" bl"o"rt'` becomes `['foo', 'bar mumble', 'baz frotz', 'blort']`. This job is performed by the `tokenizer.tokenize` function. Next we need to parse the tokens into a meaningful structure, this is done by `command.parse` which accepts the tokens as input.

From this set of tokens, the parser is assumes the first one to be the verb. Then it looks if it can find a preposition (e.g. `in`, `from`, `on`). If it does then all the tokens before it are considered to be the direct object and all the tokens after it will be considered the indirect object. If we don't find a preposition then everything (except the verb) is considered to be the direct object. In any case, all object tokens are joined back together into a single string (using a space character).

Resolving
=====
After this we have a raw command specification but we can't really do anything with it yet before we resolve it in the game world. We can do this by feeding the parse output into the `world.resolve` function. This will return an even better command dictionary where hopefully all the object references such as `iobj` and `dobj` have been filled in.

Also, if a valid command was supplied, this updated command dictionary should point to a function on an object somewhere in the game world. The game runtime is responsible for executing this function using the rest of of the information available from the command dictionary.
